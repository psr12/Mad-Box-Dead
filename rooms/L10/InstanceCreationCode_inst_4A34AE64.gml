level 12?

The darkness effect is the only time I touched blend modes,
and probably the last.

The level's layout is based on Example Levels 3 if you can spot it;
they're just mashed together.
I wanted to put some enemies but they're totally unreactable with the darkness.

Song is Gigabyte Grounds, from Kirby Planet Robobot.
Because robots!
The song's pretty short, it's just a map screen diddy.
