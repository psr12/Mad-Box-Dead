level 12?

Oooh, very spooky.
The only time I've touched blend modes, and probably the last.

The level's layout is based on Example Levels 3 if you can spot it;
they're just mashed together.
I wanted to put some enemies but they're totally unreactable with the darkness.

Song is Gigabyte Grounds, from Kirby Planet Robobot.
Robots!
The song's pretty short, it's just a map screen diddy.
