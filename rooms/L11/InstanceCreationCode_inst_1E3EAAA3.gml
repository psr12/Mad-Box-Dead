level 13?

I had a freaking brain blast with those screws.
A winding mind trail, but they're based off the Shredder Fight in Turtles in Time.
I loved how there's a instakill where you throw the enemy at the screen.
Then you fight Shredder, seeing the fight from his cockpit, wondering how to hit him.
Then it hits you and you go 'No way...', as you think of a new way to use that 
visual flourish as a real game mechanic.
So I was thinking about how you could affect something by spinning on it,
since the charge dance is just for flourish too.
Originally, I was gonna have the screw move up or down based on if you were 
facing left or right, but I figured players wouldn't know what caused it to go up or down.

You can get softlocked in the pit with the giant screw, if you have invincibility on.

I played Detective Pikachu recently, which is why I put in the 
'Arty convos'. You can hit space or click on him, by the way.
They're a lot buggy though, so be gentle and don't move.

Song is Automatic Action, from Donkey Kong Country Returns.
Because it's a factory song, obviously!
