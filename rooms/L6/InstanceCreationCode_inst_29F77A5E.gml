level 7?

Made it outside! Or, is that bad?

Introducing, wind! 
The eagle fight is what made me include the mechanic first,
the wind areas came afterwards.
The way the leaf particles work is a mess, but overall it wasn't too hard.

You can climb up the gutter in the middle to see the first falling platforms and balloons.
The U bend at the end is a little crooked, isn't it?
You can just walk up the wall before the goal, if the wind's giving you trouble.

Song is UK Exploration, from Bakugan: Defenders of the Core.
A nice sweeping song, for a sweeping level.
All the songs are just from my music playlist, by the way...
