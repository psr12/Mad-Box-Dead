level 7?

We're outside, but that's not actually a good thing. Kind of like the original game.

I made wind for the eagle fight, and decided to use it in levels.

The song is UK Exploration, from Bakugan: Defenders of the Core.
A nice sweeping song, for a sweeping level.
Most of the songs are just from my music playlist.
