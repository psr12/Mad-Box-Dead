Song is Undying, by DDRKirby.
Song was picked kinda late; I had one more cutscene than levels...

This is basically the same as if aliens had showed up.
I would put in more foreshadowing, but I couldn't work it in.

The first half being invisible was an accident, but I kinda liked it.
Otherwise nothing too crazy.
That's next level. h ah ha ha h ah a 

Considered songs: 
	Pac Man World 2 - Suba Duba
	Shadow the Hedgehod - Digital Circuit
	something 'digital', a happy normal song
