In case you watched the original 'Mad Rat Dead Robot AU' video,
the symblolism with the chicks fell through, and they got fridged.
I didn't break Arty's face panel either; it just didn't look right.

Everything's all glitchy in the digital world.
I thought the outline filter would be nicer than it is, but had to dial it back to just certain areas.

The song is Virtual Dimension, from Kirby Planet Robobot.
I haven't played it, but I went through the OST just because of the theme and
came out with three pretty different songs.
