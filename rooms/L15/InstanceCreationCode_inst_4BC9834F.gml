Sorry, I had to kill the chicks off for thematic reasons.
We never got the cute scene of them nuzzling Mad Rat...

We've been taken to digi-land! 
Everything's all glitchy on purpose! I swear!
I thought the room filter would be nicer than it is, and had to dial it back to just certain areas.
Put in water after the fact, just to get some extra stage gimmicks in.

Song is Virtual Dimension, from Kirby Planet Robobot.
I haven't played it, but I went through the OST just because of the theme and
came out with three pretty different songs.
