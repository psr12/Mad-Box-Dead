Level 5(?)

This one was finished way before any of the normal levels.
They were supposed to look like the jar-head concept art of the Mob Rats,
but it never came together right.
Still, I think this fits the theme better, and has a parallel in those 
cartoon wind up rats that don't actually exist.
The scalpel rat is unnecesarilly cool.

Song is Bad Feeling, from Mad Rat Dead, The only representative from the original game.
It's been pitched down slightly,from the extra weight of their mechanical bodies.
I considered adding in an alarm sound, but there's radar sound in the song already.

This was the inspiration for the whole story mode, 
if you can believe that; from the 'Bad Feelings at different pitches' video.
40% has a real 'attack of the martians' / 'march of the robots' feel to it.
So I sort of worked backwards and had to come up with a way to get to that concept,
such as if the Doctor was a roboticist instead.
