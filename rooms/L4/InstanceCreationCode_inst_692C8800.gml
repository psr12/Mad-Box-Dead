Level 5(?)

This one was finished way before any of the normal levels, as you may alreay know.
The design ended up different from the 'concept art' Mob Rats.
And by different, I mean lazier... Sorry...
Still, I think this fits the theme better, and has a parallel in those 
cartoon wind up rats that don't actually exist.
God, the sword rat is just too cool!

Song is Bad Feeling, from... you know!
The only representative from the original game.
It's been pitched down slightly, due to the extra weight of their mechanical bodies!
I considered adding in an alarm sound, but there's a conspicuous radar 
beep in the song already...

This was the inspiration for the whole story mode, 
if you can believe that; from the 'Bad Feelings at different pitches' video.
40% has a real 'attack of the martians' / 'march of the robots' feel to it.
So I sort of worked backwards and had to come up with a way to get to that concept,
such as if the Doctor was a roboticist instead.
