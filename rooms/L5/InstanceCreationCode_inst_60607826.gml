Level 6? 

Mad Rat thinks the alarm is because of what he's done, and he might be right
since there's no fire. I actually don't have an explanation.
*but with the new ending, we can say it was the virus.

I had to retool the Mob Rats a bit to work outside their level.
They're kinda awkward, but I didn't want to introduce the other
enemies until we made it outside.

The song is Glow, from Mighty Switch Force 2.
I specifically picked this one for the alarm in the beginning, as the 
impetus for leaving the building.
