Level 6? 

Uh oh! The 'mecha-rats are dying' alarm!
As if. But there's not actually a fire, so... Maybe it is?

Had to retool the Mob Rats a bit to work outside their level.
They're kinda awkward, but I didn't want to introduce the other
enemies until we made it outside.

Song is Glow, from Mighty Switch Force 2.
Specifically picked this one for the alarm in the beginning, as the 
impetus for leaving the building.
