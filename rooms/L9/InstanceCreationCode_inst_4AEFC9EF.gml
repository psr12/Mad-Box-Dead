level 11?

Blatantly copied from I wanna be the sewer survivor, but I put some 
personal flourishes. (And removed some harder to implement stuff ...)
Saw that and couldn't resist.
Was going to put a filler level between this and the bird level, but there's a lot
of waiting in this level, so I figured that's enough of a wind down.

Big guy at the end doesn't hurt you, by the way. He loves you!
Couldn't figure out how to make him scarier...
I made new Mob Rats just for this, that removes their vulnerable period.
Not because I needed them to be invincible, but because you can't homing attack
in the water, and I wanted to avoid confusion.
The ones at the end can end up in the water though, where you can't kill them.

Song is The sewage rings and one mouse(?), by O-SE.
I added in Jerma at 0:16, of course. It wasn't just an idea I had; I could hear it.
Take that as you will.
