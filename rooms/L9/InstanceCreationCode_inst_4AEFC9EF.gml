level 11?

Blatantly copied from I wanna be the sewer survivor, but I put some 
personal flourishes. (And removed some harder to implement stuff ...)
I was going to put a filler level between this and the bird level, but there's a lot
of waiting in this level, so I figured that's enough of a cool down.

There's a huge monster if you wait at the end, but it doesn't hurt you.
It's goofy looking too, so don't look too hard.
I made new Mob Rats just for this, that have no vulnerable period.
It's because water prevents homing attacks, and it was frustrating that 
you would get the opportunity to hit them, but can't.
The ones on the barrels can end up in the water though, where you can't kill them.

The song is something like 'Sewer rumblings and one mouse', but in Japanese, by O-SE.
I added the Jerma clip in the song, of course. My mind automatically inserted that there,
even on my first time hearing the song.
