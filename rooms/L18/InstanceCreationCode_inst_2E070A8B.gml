Don't zoom out here... The background loops forever and will eat CPU, so let's wrap up here.

-I uh.. couldn't think of an ending. I wanted to throw in a little science fact in the ending, to mirror the parasite fact from the original.
-Apologies to 'Dr. FamilyPC', and anyone who gets doxxed
-the sprites in the project are the same as the sprites in the folders, so they're just there for demonstration purposes
  EXCEPT! if you delete the Arty sprites, you get the original Heart sprites back. A bonus for astute players who hate self inserts.
-there's a bunch of writing I stole, 'barging in on your story' is from Vindictus pre-rewrite. 
  'There's nowhere left to cut open' is from Gungrave CD. 
- I'm not necessarily going to stop working on this but, same as before, it'll just be whenever something strikes me.

Let's see... any scrapped or planned things?
-Songs that didn't make it in: minuit a fond la caisse, Part time lover, sneakman, dysthymia, steal a march
  Vento Aureo OST: Buccellati, A-TTACK, launch hearts, smrpg factory theme, 
-I wanted Arty to do stuff like push the camera back, or change the window size in the last fight, but it was kinda dangerous.
  or a flashbang attack that disables the notes and music, or in the glitchy area mess with the notes visually
-the original plot is in the Robot AU discription, basically they just made up and left town together, and humanity isn't dead.
  then I was gonna have Mad Rat actually be a robot, and he was passed out for like a year while the apocolypse happened
  but with how humanity is dead that probably has to be the case anyway? I just didn't specify
-challenge levels, framed as flashbacks to lab testing, where there's a special challenge/song combo
- more microgames for after story mode, since they don't have to be lab tests anymore
- A cutscene where Arty has to do an update, so he says 'keep coughing' and disappears
  'What the heck does that mean?' and Mad Rat passes out, since Arty isn't pumping blood
