text = @"E1, The first 'extra' stage. 

Song is Old House, from the NASH music library. 
I don't know the actual composer.

Originally, this part was going to be silent. It stunk.
I thought it might be interesting if you could move freely,
but I never even tried to implement that.

I wanted this to a kind of free-roaming level, where you explore the lab 
in a non-linear way. I couldn't think of how to do that.
I thought maybe it could be like, multiple vertical floors, idk.

You can't fall off the 'tables'. There's a platform down there.

Considered songs: Haymakers - Rooted Wood 1
	probably something from Maplestory
	something with a loney feel, with a bit of sadness
