Level 9?

A simple combat focused level.
I couldn't figure out too much to do with this enemy.
Watch out for the beehive at the end!
There's a homing attack path over the ditch, and through the wind.

The song is Honest Hearts battle theme, from Fallout 4.
Mostly because of the name, and a bit of the eerie feeling.
