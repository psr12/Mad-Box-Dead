Song is Crazy, from Mad World. Instrumental ver.

This was supposed to be Mad Rat's memory crawl, to contrast with Arty's in L16.
But more of a trial of the mind, where he confronts the things that happened.
I didn't have a lot of ideas though, so it's pretty tepid.

Anyways, the level is pretty normal, but I like it.
The windy balloon climb can be skipped by going right instead of up.
I prempted it would be hard, but it's nothing special. I left the shortcut though.

Considered songs: 
	Sexy Brutale - Heaven and Hell
		^ I really wanted to use a Sexy Brutale, but nothing fits anywhere
	something dark, a little spooky
