Song is Crazy, from Mad World. Instrumental ver.

This was supposed to be Mad Rat's memory crawl, to contrast
with Arty's in L16.
But with stuff he imagines, rather than memories.
It's pretty barebones, though... You'll have to just pretend.
Take a moment, and think about it.
Mmmmmm.....

Anyways, the level is pretty normal, but I like it.
The windy ballon climb can be skipped by going right instead of up.
I prempted it would be hard, but it's nothing special. I left the shortcut though.

Considered songs: 
	Sexy Brutale - Heaven and Hell
		^ I really wanted to use Sexy Brutale, but nothing fits
	something dark, a little spooky
