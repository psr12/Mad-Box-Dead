Fourth level!
or Stage 3, part 2?
The weird name is because this level was inserted after level 4 was made.
It was made later in development, hence the higher complexity, but
it wasn't made after all the other levels were finished.
I still had 5 or so to go, and the story wasn't nailed down yet,
but I knew for certain there had to be some extra levels at the start for pacing.

Song is Drawing Theme, from Drawn to Life.
Uh... I don't know as many songs as I thought, so this one's a bit out of nowhere.
The tone's fitting enough, but I would want some more 'lab-esque' instruments.
A hopeful song, with a plucky smile-while-crying melody.
