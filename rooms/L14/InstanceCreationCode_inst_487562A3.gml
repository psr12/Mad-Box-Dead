level 16?

As promised, the same bird.

Was originally gonna be 'Berdetta' (as in girl bird), to match the level of care
given to 'ARTY the artifical heart', but went with Beretta (as in the gun(I guess it's also a name)).
They're cool, fast, and ultimately, a tool.
...Okay, maybe strike cool. Not after the chicken noises and getting bonked by a rat.

If you wanted more spectacle, imagine a world where you start on a windowsil,
then after each phase you get blown up a level until you reach the roof.
And each phase, Arty uses holograms to confuse you or direct the bird.
I was originally gonna have the hit markers be a holographic scribble of Mad Rat,
like Arty was getting Beretta to attack there, but that doesn't make sense if you think about it.
The attacks are ALL taken from Buzzar from Paper Mario, I couldn't find any other 'bird' attacks...
The sound when you hit the head is actually an attack sound from Worms (New Yorker).

Song is VS GREEN BIKER DUDE, by RRThiel.
And, I guess, the MMX2 Introstage.
This song inspired the fight, although I don't know how.
I guess I just found it at the same time I had the idea and they clicked.
The wing flaps and the talons striking and the whooshing feathers and the bobbing shadow...
