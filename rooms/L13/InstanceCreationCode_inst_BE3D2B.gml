level 14?

A real wacky yet boring level. 

The platforms are supposed to represent bricks sticking out from the wall.

The song is Pristine Office, from Kirby Planet Robobot.
This song was supposed to be really different from the last 2, 
to show the difference of the 'upper lab' and 'lower lab'.
I rerouted Mad Rat outside so he would end up on the roof,
but I think it still fits.
