Song is Proof of the Existence. I think it was made for Jubeat,
but it's in a couple rhythm games.

Originally, it was revealed here that Arty was accidentally created
by the doctor. All his talk of being a 'parter' were generous untruths;
He was 'asisting', but never revealed his existence to the doctor.
It came out of nowhere, and didn't go anywhere, so I cut it.
It was the song that made me think of it;
It gives me a cold and desperate, but hopeful feeling; plus the title.

Instead of that, the virus tries to appeal to Arty in the cutscene.
But he denies it from the start.
Perhaps after all his time with Mad Rat he's got too much 'humanity'?
