Mixed-field, as in... Bio-mechanics!

The same as the idle rat, but cuter!

The only true use of the falling platforms, just because they're kinda iffy.
I especially like the final stretch, even though it's simple.
It would be really easy, but he won't move! It's clean, damn it!

Song is Mecha City part 4, from Sanctuary RPG (black edition?)
Mecha!
Was originally gonna be part 6, but I think this one fits better here,
as a mix of heavy machinery and the intricate mecha-rats.
