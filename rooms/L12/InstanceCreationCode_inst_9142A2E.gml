The mixed field joke is because the mecha-rats got into the mechanical lab,
but they already qualify as being bio-mechanics projects on their own.

The sweeping rat is the same as the idle rat, just cuter.
I like the sweeping rats on the really small platform.
I didn't use the falling platforms much, because they're iffy.

Song is Mecha City part 4, from Sanctuary RPG (black edition?)
Used for the general mecha feel.
Was originally gonna be part 6, but I think part 4 fits better here,
as a mix of heavy machinery and the intricate mecha-rats.
