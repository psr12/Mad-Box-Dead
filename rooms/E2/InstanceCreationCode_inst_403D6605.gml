Song is Macuilxochitl , by TOMOSUKE 

In the original ending, I intended for Arty to go quiet but not die,
Like Parasyte.

The level is very unthemed, and should probably be going left.
Levels E2 - E7 are all based on Sonic Mania.
Even if I say that, you probably can't tell. But it's true.
I watched a playthrough and copied any usable level design.

Considered songs: NASH - Not Over Yet
	A-TTACK
	something upbeat, maybe a bit panicked, but happy overall
