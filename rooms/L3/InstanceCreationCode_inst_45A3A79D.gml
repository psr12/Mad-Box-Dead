Third level!
Introduces a bunch of stage gimmicks.
Bit of a stretch, but the slides represent that things are moving plot-wise.
I gave up on making the levels lab-themed around this time.

The song is Machine Remix, from Rhythm Heaven Megamix
This song was in 'Mad Rat Dead Robot AU', but I was gonna cut it because I only like
the intro. But I like the intro so much I kept it anyway.
The punky electric guitar that moves ahead fits well with Mad Rat.

The entire story mode is literally a Machine Remix, or, that was the intention.
Mad Rat's still mostly flesh and blood.
