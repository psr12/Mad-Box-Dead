Third level!
Introduces a bunch of stage gimmicks.
I wanted the slides specifically to show that you're gaining momentum now.
As in, story-wise.
The whole level is completely abstract, no lab would look like this!

Song is Machine Remix, from Rhythm Heaven Megamix
Was originally going to cut this because I only liked the intro of the song,
but boy, I REALLY like the intro.
The punky electric guitar that moves ahead in small bursts...
Reminds you of Mad Rat, doesn't it?
Plus, it was promised in my AU video.

The entire story mode is literally a Machine Remix, or, that was the intention...
Mad Rat's still flesh and blood, as far as you know!
