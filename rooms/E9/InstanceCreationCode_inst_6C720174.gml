Song is Indefatigable, by MOMODEMO

Genuinely, this song was the inspiration for the whole 'E' series of levels.
If the title was different, I probably wouldn't have.
But I thought of a 'Hopes and Dreams' moment, where you have infinite battery.
So you're 'indefatigable'.
Although I usually see that used to mean someone too dumb to get tired.

I went into this with just the idea that you'd vault off Arty to hit the boss.
The attacks are loosely based on the actual Rat God fight.

The unique sounds are all from Melty Blood, which I picked randomly. I haven't played.

The orb attack was going to be much larger in scope, like they throw out a whole web
of them. I have no excuse.
If you die during the 'megalaser', Arty gets embarassed.

Sorry about the picky entrance to the obstacle course.
