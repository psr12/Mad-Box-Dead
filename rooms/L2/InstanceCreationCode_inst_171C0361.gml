Second level!
Still in the lab.
The only lab equipment is the wierd things before the end. They're supposed to be 
holders for microscope slides.
Everything else is just abstract.
The 'chairs' in the beginning are designed such that you can mount them
with the dash bounce, then dash across the tops.
I just wanted a curved tunnel in the middle, but the top part
ended up looking like a space invader.

Song is I [heart] You, from Heart and Slash.
Didn't like the game that much, but the intro left a big impact on me;
the way the tutorial just boots you into a run, and you start wandering the lab to this song.
An uptempo boppy song, but somehow lonely. Plus, it's got heart in the name!
