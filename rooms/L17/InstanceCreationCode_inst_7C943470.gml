level 19?

Surfaces and cameras are fucking complicated!
But it was worth it! Look at that sweet monitor wall!


Song is You Are Mine, by Pinosuke.
I couldn't not use it! Even the title fits!
You might expect this to have been the impetus for the whole story, but I found it way after.
In fact, it didn't fit with my original plot, so I ended up rewriting some stuff.
I changed the throughline from 'you don't have to listen to your creator' to
'don't chase what's gone'. Quite the shift, huh?
You can blame Pino for the dead birds.

NOTE: Some stuff is left intentionally vague.
If there's one or two possible explanations, it's probably on purpose.
If there's something that just doesn't make any sense at all, please tell me.
Except Heart showing up at the end and talking, I know it's wack.
