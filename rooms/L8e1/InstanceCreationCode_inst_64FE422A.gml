level 10?

A bird, as promised.
The 'Call me Jack', of the game.
Arty's just pretending, he wants it to seem like the situation in Mad Rat Dead.
When in fact, he's causing it!

The idea is: you want to take the upper paths, but are forced
to drop to the lower paths because of the bird.
I made sure you actually can take the upper path if you know the level enough.
Consider it a challenge!

Song is Theme of Really Cool Bird, by Bobacupcake.
You're not in change now, so you're not the guitar anymore!
I have the danger zones set up to skip the first audio cue,
to make room for the song's screech.
So it's a little awkward when you use other songs, but I couldn't get it
to detect what song is playing.
