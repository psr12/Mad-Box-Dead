Song is Soul to Burn, from Tokyo Xanadu.
I just found the song randomly, and decided to put it in during development.

I don't explain it, but Arty's supposed to be like
on another plane of existence, and you have to match frequencies 
to see him. 

Considered songs:
	Kubbi - Firelight
	Levelhead - Professional Development
	A-hisa - Alexthymia, or Dysthymia
		^specifically, this is my 'Emmental catalepsy' level
	something hopeful, but not on the level of Heartless Being
