Song is HERE WE ARE, from Undertale.

Ahhh, now I get it. You gotta do it again, in the dark.
All the fall platforms are removed, too. Since you used them already.
But what's going on with Arty?

This level features special 'skip' notes.
They don't impact the timing, so just play as normal.

My original idea was to just skip ahead, but that would throw off the sync.
Next I tried to insert extra time after skip notes, and skip that.
I couldn't get it to work, particularly on loop.
Now it skips ahead a set ammount, then pauses note playback for that ammount of time.
You can thusly hit notes very early, so watch out.


Considered songs: 
	Mighty Switch Force 2 - Final Level	
	something from MADWORLD, prob Crimson Rain or Deathwatch
