Song is HERE WE ARE, from Undertale.

Ahhh, that's why it's so simple. You gotta do it again, in the dark.
All the falling platforms are removed, too. Since you used them already.
But what's going on with Arty?

This level features special 'skip' notes.
They don't impact the timing, so just play as normal.

My original idea for skip notes was to just skip ahead, but that would throw off the sync.
I tried making it so a skip note inserts extra space, and then when you hit
the skip note the extra space gets deleted, to keep the timing intact.
I couldn't get it to work, particularly on loop.
Now it skips ahead a set ammount, then pauses note playback for that ammount of time.
After a skip, you can hit the next note very early, so watch out.


Considered songs: 
	Mighty Switch Force 2 - Final Level	
	something from MADWORLD, prob Crimson Rain or Deathwatch
