Song is GO BACK 2 YOUR RAVE, by nora2r .

This rat god obstacle was made long ago, for the level editor.

The 'lock in' segments are from an idea I had about what to add to a 'Jack' level.
Like, you get trapped, and have to fend off a patterned claw swipe barrage.

The danger zones are faster than normal; 16 beats instead of 24
but only last 1 beat, instead of 2.

I tried to have every obstacle so far in this level.
It's simple overall, since you have to also deal with rat god.


Considered songs:
	something frantic and upbeat, maybe hardbass or eurobeat
